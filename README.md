## Wiki App

[See it in action](http://wiki-app-ghbooth12.herokuapp.com)

Wiki app is a production quality SaaS app that allows users to create their own wikis. Users can create public and private Markdown-based wikis.

Wikis are a great way to collaborate on community-sourced content. Whether the wiki is for a hobby or work-related project, users can create their own wikis and share them publicly or privately with other collaborators.
